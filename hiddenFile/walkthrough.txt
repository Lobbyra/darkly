1. By looking to the robots.txt file, we found the .hidden/ path in it.
2. With a first request we found an index html page that link to many many subdirectories
3. As this route is name hidden, it must have a hidden file with something interesting in there
4. So we made a script to download all the sub directories. You'll find it in the ressources dir.
5. Finally, we made a tiny script to display all the content from those file and filter the useless content to find this :

PS: The script is a bit long to execute, so take your time :)
