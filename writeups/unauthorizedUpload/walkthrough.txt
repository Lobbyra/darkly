There is a page used to upload images at : /index.php?page=upload

There is a button to select a file and another to send it.

If the file is a jpg image, the site tell you /tmp/[your file] succesfully uploaded.

If the image you uploaded through the UI is not an image, the website tells you : Your image was not uploaded.

The front send the file with the multipart/form-data content-type.

With this type of sending, the file MIME type is send by the client and the server look at this to know if it's a jpg or another file.

With the help of curl, with can manually set this type and send anything we want.
So with this command you can send any file you want by specifing the parsed MIME type:

curl --trace-ascii - -F "Upload=send" \
-F "uploaded=@ressources/malicious.sh;type=image/jpeg" \
"http://localhost:9090/index.php\?page\=upload"

The response contains the flag
