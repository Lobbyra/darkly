1. If you click on the copyright link in the bottom of the home page, you will be redirected to a weird page

Here is the full url page :
http://172.16.91.134/index.php?page=b7e44c7a40c5f80139f0a50f3650fb2bd8d00b0d24667c4c2ca32c88e13b758f

In the source code of the page, there is a long comment part that have two important instructions

> You must come from : "https://www.nsa.gov/".
[...]
> Let's use this browser : "ft_bornToSec". It will help you a lot.

For the first part, we have to change the referer http header to https://www.nsa.gov/
The second part is more about to change the User-Agent header to "ft_bornToSec"

Here is the curl command to achieve that and the response contain the flag !

curl --location 'http://172.16.91.134/index.php?page=b7e44c7a40c5f80139f0a50f3650fb2bd8d00b0d24667c4c2ca32c88e13b758f' \
--header 'User-Agent: ft_bornToSec' \
--header 'Referer: https://www.nsa.gov/' | grep flag
