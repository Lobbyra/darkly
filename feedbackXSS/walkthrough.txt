Ok this one is really weird.

In the homepage, there is a button "leave a feedback" that redirect to a page with a form.

In this form, there are 2 fields "name" & "message" that needs to be non-empty to make the form valid.

With the Help of the wapiti tools that checks various type of vulnerabilities in websites, i found an XSS in the name field.

So here is the exploit request :

curl "http://172.16.91.134/?page=feedback" \
-e "http://172.16.91.134/?page=feedback" \
-d "txtName=%3CScRiPt%3Ealert%28%27blurp%27%29%3C%2FsCrIpT%3E&btnSign=Sign+Guestbook&mtxtMessage=Hi+there%21"

Here is the URL decoded txtName value : <ScRiPt>alert('blurp')</sCrIpT>

As you can see here, "script" key-words are not lowercased and this is important to make the request be an XSS.
Unless, the feedback is just not saved in the DB.

So the XSS work but no flags appear...

For this flag, you just need the souls of the randomness and just create a feedback with a random name and "alert" in message.
With this very specific technique, the flag will appear and you are a successfull H4ck3r !

If you feel like a different personm you can also type "script" in the name field and let you inspiration type a random message and YES, the flag will appear again.

This is a very weird flag...

By the way the flag is 0fbb54bbf7d099713ca4be297e1bc7da0173d8b3c21c1811b916a3a86652724e
